1. Verify master is in a clean state
git checkout master
git status

Expected output:
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean

If itâ€™s not clean, commit or stash changes before continuing.

2. List all available branches
git branch -a

The branch with * is the current branch.
remotes/origin/... shows remote branches.

3. Pull the remote repository into master
git pull origin master

This ensures your local master is up to date with the remote.
If there are changes on the remote, they will be merged into your local master.

4. Push pending changes from Git-T03-HOL_002 to remote
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Git-T03-HOL_002 changes"
git push origin master

git add . stages all pending changes.
git commit saves them to your local repo.
git push sends them to the remote repository.

5. Verify changes in the remote repository
Open your GitHub repository in a browser.
Check the latest commit message to confirm your changes are reflected.

You can also run:
git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all

to confirm that your local and remote branches are aligned.
